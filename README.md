# UTDR-Music-Randomizer
A simple program to randomize the audio files for Undertale and Deltarune. Generates cursed content.
## How to Use
1) Locate your base install folder for Undertale or Deltarune (where the EXE is)
2) Choose your preferred options (described below)
3) Click randomize
4) Enjoy the chaos!
## Options
* Include cyber.ogg and mansion.ogg — Only applies to Deltarune. Excluded by default because editing these songs can affect gameplay.
* Include cyber_battle_prelude.ogg — Only applies to Deltarune. May softlock if the replacement song is shorter than the original.
* Include Your Best Nightmare + Finale — Only applies to Undertale. Excluded by default since these songs are split into multiple files.
* Include credits songs — Adds "Bring It In, Guys!", "Last Goodbye", "Don't Forget", and "Until Next Time" to the rotation.
* Include ambience — Adds ambient sounds to the rotation (birds chirping, wind SFX, etc.)
* Include rhythm game songs - Adds the layered songs from Deltarune ch.3's minigame to the rotation. May sound REALLY bad.
* Include jingles and sound effects — Adds sound effects and short songs to the rotation. May sound EVEN MORE bad.
## Note
The randomizer does not verify if all of the audio files are meant to be there, so any other OGG files that are in the folder will be randomized too. Use this information wisely.
